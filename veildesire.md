###That Veil of Desire

As Derrida pointed out, fear makes the sovereign, but as Laclau shows the sovereign needs confrontation; the variable missing from this equation is desire. The sovereign needs the confrontation to generate fear, but the underlying drive for both is the desire for power and control. In the Canadian election context (an election being the formally recognized democratic quest for power), ISIS and Baghdadi as external enemies could not adequately generate enough fear to swing voters outside the Conservative base. In response, Harper and the Conservatives shone the spotlight on potential internal enemies by instituting a ban on veils during citizenship ceremonies. This ban reflects the sovereign ban of Agamben; the election for Harper, in essence, consisted of his desire for the permission of the electorate to redraw the juridico-cultural boundaries of Canadian society and make outlaws the (Muslim) women of the veil.

So far in my argument, the discussion of desire has focused on early representations of Muslim women as seductresses prone to the animal desires who in turn stoke immoral desires of Western men. In this sense, desire is gendered along the lines of women producing sexual desire in men. In the medieval and early modern era "this particular form of veiling [veiling with only eyes showing] was not seen as a token of modesty but instead was criticized as seductive, mysterious and rebellious" (Burghatz) while in the colonial era and at the height of Orientalism the veil conveyed a desire to be conquered: "This highly aestheticized treatment sustains a nineteenth-century photographic convention depicting the eroticized, unattainable, and exotic “Oriental” woman. Imprisoned behind the veil, she became the central ﬁgure in a romantic fantasy of conquest and possession. Removing the veil marks the ultimate form of colonization" (Gula 277). Yet in the twenty-first century, this image of veiled Muslim women has somewhat fallen out of favour in response to the use of the veil in terrorist or political activities: "Hence what was once familiar and recognizable as concealment, mask, masquerading, has now become unfamiliar, disturbing, and uncanny" (Yegenoglu 560). As a result of the cracks in the idea of a sexual desirable woman underneath the veil, the desire for power and control becomes apparent: "_the veiled woman can see without being seen_" (Yegenoglu 546). She mirrors the surveillance of the state[^1]. Yet, this situation reflects Slavoj Zizek's point that "there is more truth in the mask we wear" (92). The niqab does not disguise what the modern sovereign or colonizer seeks, it is what they seek.
