The officials of the French administration in Algeria, commit­ ted to destroying the people's originality, and under instruc­ tions to bring about the disintegration, at whatever cost, of forms of existence likely to evoke a national reality d irectly or indirectly, were to concentrate their efforts on the wearing of the veil, which was looked upon at this juncture as a symbol of the status of the Algerian woman fanon

Beneath the patrilineal pattern of Algerian society, the spe­ cialists described a structure of matrilineal essence. Arab society has often been presented by Westerners as a formal society in

which outside appearances are paramount. The Algerian woman, an intermediary between obscure forces and the group, appeared in this perspective to assume a primordial importance. Behind the visible, manifest patriarchy, the more significant existence of a basic matriarchy was affirmed. The role of the Algerian mother, that of the grandmother , the aunt and the " old woman," were inventoried and defined. fanon

The behavior of the Algerian was very fin'nly denounced and described as medieval and barbaric. With infinite science, a blanket indictment against the "sadistic and vampirish" Alge­ rian attitude toward women was prepared and drawn up fanon

Every rejected veil dis­ closed to the eyes of the colonialists horizons until then forbid­ den, and revealed to them, piece by piece, the flesh of Algeria laid bare...every face that offered itself to the bold and impatient glance of the occupier, was a negative expression of the fact that Algeria was

beginning to deny herself and was accepting the rape of the colonizer. fanon

But there is also in the European the crystallization of an aggressiveness, the strain of a kind of violence before the Al­ gerian woman. Unveiling this woman is revealing her beauty; it is baring her secret, breaking her resistance, making her avail­ able for adventure. Hiding the face is also disguising a secret; it is also creating a world of mystery, of the hidden. In a confused way. the European experiences his relation with the Algerian woman at a highly complex level. There is in it the will to bring this woman within his reach. to make her a possible ob­ ject of possessionfanon

Thus the rape of the Algerian woman in the dream of a European is always preceded by a rending of the veil. We here witness a double deflowering. Likewise, the woman's conduct is never one of consent or acceptance, but of abject humility. fanon

The tenacity of the occupier in his endeavor to unveil the women, to make of them an ally in the wor f cul tural destruction, had the effect of strengthening the tradI tIOnal patterns of behavior. Fanon

The veil protects, reassures, isolates. 59

Spontaneously and without being told, the Algerian women who had long since dropped the veil once again donned the hai'k, thus affirming that it was not true that woman liberated herself at the invitation of France and of General de Gaulle. Fanon

The veil helped the Algerian woman to meet the new problems created by the struggle.

I argue for the centrality of the cultural notion of privacy, as one that embodies the qualities of reserve, respect and restraint as these are played out in fluid transformational bi-rhythmic space. Dress in general, but particularly veiling, is privacy's visual metaphor

Arab privacy does not connote the “personal,” the “secret” or the “individuated space.” It concerns two core spheres – women and the family. For both, privacy is sacred and carefully guarded. For women it is both a right and an exclusive privilege, and is reflected in dress, space, architecture and proxemic behavior

“Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.”  - political theology

“Tell me who your enemy is, and I will tell you who you are.” Theory of the Partisan: Intermediate Commentary on the Concept of the Political

“The political enemy need not be morally evil or aesthetically ugly; he need not appear as an economic competitor, and it may even be advantageous to engage with him in business transactions. But he is, nevertheless, the other, the stranger; and it is sufficient for his nature that he is, in a specially intense way, existentially something different and alien, so that in the extreme case conflicts with him are possible. These can neither be decided by a previously determined general norm nor by the judgment of a disinterested and therefore neutral third party.”

Carl Schmitt, The Concept of the Political: Expanded Edition 

For Derrida, the most revealing passage in all of Schmitt’s writings—and quite possibly the catalyst for Derrida’s own theory of spectrality—is Schmitt’s statement that, without the friend-enemy grouping, all major political concepts risk becoming “empty and ghostlike abstractions [my emphasis]” (The Concept of the Political 30). The transformation of the concrete enemy into the spec- tral enemy is, Derrida asserts, “the political crime” that Schmitt most fears (Politics of Friendship ix). Following Nietzsche, however, Derrida 
deliberately commits this “political crime,” which is to say, Derrida seeks to deconstruct essentialist concepts of both the friend and the enemy -Christpoher Wise

Schmitt insists that to prevent such c quences, the sovereign must be the one who “definitely” decides on the state of exception.

Signiﬁcantly, Kristeva’s discussion of abjection in Powers of Horror begins to suggest the uses of this structuralist notion of a boundary-constituting taboo for the purposes of constructing a discrete subject through exclusion. 62 The “abject” designates that which has been expelled from the body, discharged as excrement, literally rendered “Other.” This appears as an expul- sion of alien elements, but the alien is eﬀectively established through this expulsion. The construction of the “not-me” as the abject establishes the boundaries of the body which are also the ﬁrst contours of the subject. Kristeva writes: Butler Gender Trouble 181

The basis of a communal English identity rests on that prior identification when Richard grasps for the first time that he has committed cannibalism: in the shock when the black face of the Saracen head, produced by the terrified cook, stares at him. Richard’s gaze instantly takes in, and establishes beyond question, the ev- idence of cannibalism and the evidence of racial-religious difference, in what is undeniably a racial recognition: the instant in which the darkness of Saracen skin—a biological, genetic marker of racial difference—pulls into stark focus the Islamic otherness of the enemy, in opposition to Eng- lish Christians. Next comes the Saracen’s black beard, a sign of cultural difference—masculinity defined by religion and ethnicity—but a cultural alterity that signally acts to confirm the essential biological nature an- nounced by the skin. 7 So important is this seemingly casual presentation that color is the first thing that we, and Richard, are forced to see, in ac- knowledging the victim: for the black face (“swarte vys,” 3211), “blacke berd,” and “whyte teeb” (3212), and widely grinning lips (“lyppys gren- nyd wyde,” 3213) definitively establish the dead Saracen (and not the can- nibalistic Christian king) as the “devil” (“deuyl,” 3214) that Richard immediately designates him. Invisibly, via the visible intelligibility of color, a racializing discourse has surfaced alongside the discourse of na- tionalism and colonization with which it is blended through humor—the racialized humor of the collective national joke. 8

The political is the most intense and extreme antagonism, and every concrete antagonism becomes that much more political the closer it approaches the most extreme point, that of the friend-enemy grouping. In its entirety the state as an organized political entity decides for itself the friend-enemy distinction. Furthermore, next to the primary political decisions and under the protection of the decision taken, numerous secondary concepts of the political ema- nate. Schmitt

Never in the thousand-year struggle between Chris- tians and Moslems did it occur to a Christian to surrender rather than defend Europe out of love toward the Saracens or Turks. The enemy in the political sense need not be hated personally, and in the private sphere only does it make sense to love one's enemy, i.e., one's adversary. The Bible quotation touches the political antithesis even less than it intends to dissolve, for example, the antithesis of good and evil or beautiful and ugly. It certainly does not mean that one should love and support the enemies of one's own people.schmitt

They are focused on a specific conflict and are bound to a concrete situation; the result (which manifests itself in war or revolution) is a friend-enemy grouping, and they turn into empty and ghostlike abstractions when this situa- tion disappears. Words such as state, republic,l1 society, class, as well as sovereignty, constitutional state, absolutism, dictatorship, economic planning, neutral or total state, and so on, are incomprehensible if one does not know exactly who is to be affected, combated, refuted, or negated by such a term

But he is, nevertheless, the other, the stranger; and it is sufficient for his nature that he is, in a specially intense way, existentially something different and alien, so that in the extreme case conflicts with him are possible. schmitt

Emotionally the enemy is easily treated as being evil and ugly, because every distinction, most of all the political, as the strongest and most intense of the distinctions and categorizations, draws upon other distinctions for support. This does not alter the autonomy of such distinctions. Consequently, the reverse is also true: the morally evil, aesthetically ugly or economically damaging need not necessarily be the enemy; the morally good, aesthetically beautiful, and economically profitable need not necessarily become the friend in the specifically political sense of the word. Thereby the inherently objective nature and autonomy of the political be- comes evident by virtue of its being able to treat, distinguish, and comprehend the friend-enemy antithesis independently of other antitheses schmitt

If the public enemy and the private enemy cannot be rigorously discriminated, the purity of the political m u s t be interminably suspended. Derrida suggests that Schmitt's attempt to refound politics by policing the boundary between public and private is symptomatic of the impossibility of establishing such limits:
at every point when this border is threatened, fragile, porous, contestable (we thus designate so many possibilities that 'our time' is accentuating and accelerating in countless ways) the Schmittian discourse collapses. It is against the threat of this ruin that his discourse takes form. [POF 88 l 107]
