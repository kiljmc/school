The question of who “sees” whom is focal in Arab society. Space is a highly structured relationship in which open (undefined) spaces are rare. When Gilsenan distinguishes “being seen” from “being visible” he is making a meaningful statement about Arab culture, which considers “seeing” a marked activity and cross-sex “seeing” as closely linked to respect and privacy. Because seeing is important it must be regulated.

The veil with its intermingling of mystery and desire itself calls forth romantic associations of hide-and-seek in the game of love the veil women writers

This highly aestheticized treatment sustains a nineteenth-century pho- tographic convention depicting the eroticized, unattainable, and exotic “Oriental” woman. Imprisoned behind the veil, she became the central ﬁgure in a romantic fantasy of conquest and possession. 20 Removing the veil marks the ultimate form of colonization, fusing, as it does, narratives of oppression, desire, and imperialist expansionism. Historian Kumai Jayawardena connects the Western obsession with lifting the veil to eco- nomics: capital needs free, unconstrained bodies for work, and anything that restricts women’s mobility or enforces seclusion damages capitalism’s chances for a source of cheap labor. (the veil women writers)

. In the same vein, in the Ara- bic language, women’s sexuality is perceived as a powerful force that both captivates and corrupts men. The term ﬁtna—meaning both beauty and chaos—reﬂects the belief that women possess a powerful sexual drive that threatens the social order. The “mere proximity of a woman to a man would lead to sexual relations.” 7 Some scholars have argued that ﬁtna has been a source of fear for Islamic societies whether it is perceived collectively or within an individual man’s psyche (ibid)

Minimizing the element of religion in analyses of the veil can offer cer- tain insights into the heated debates concerning Muslim women and cloth- ing. It is not simply that Muslim women are hindered by their religion. On a basic human level, clothing is about the beautiﬁcation of the body and is designed to attract the opposite sex for the purposes of procreation. Female sexuality is harnessed for the furtherance and integrity of any com- munity, and women’s clothes, therefore, are functionally designed to si- multaneously conceal and attract attention according to prevailing local standards of beauty, modesty, and gender roles.

Female headgear serves a dual func- tion: on the one hand it is meant to hide her sexuality, on the other, it is meant to beautify and enhance her attraction. The social meanings of head coverings worldwide are as diverse as the cultures they come from


The appearance of this engraving prompted a keen discussion of the figure of the ‘covered woman’ (tapada), her head shrouded in a veil which left one eye free, to striking effect. Contrary to what we might expect, this particular form of veiling was not seen as a token of modesty but instead was criticized as seductive, mysterious and rebellious.

elevation to spiritual ideal is therefore to be conceived of as a strictly secondary phenomenon: it is a narcissistic projection whose function is to render her traumatic dimension invisible. zizek

Furthermore violence is never carried out, brought to its conclusion; it always remains suspended, as the endless repeating of interrupted gesture zizek

the brutal act upon the victim  retroactively legitimizes the act: I set out to beat a woman and when, at the very point where I think I thoroughly dominate her, I notice that I am actually her slave —since she wants the beating and provoked me to deliver it— I get mad and really beat her.

 They are as he says a cold, distanced, inhuman partner. The lady is never characterized for any of her real concrete virtues… She functions as an inhuman partner in the sense of a radical Otherness, she is simultaneously a kind of automaton, a machine which utters meaningless demands at random.. this confers on the lady her uncanny, monstrous character—the Lady as the Other which is not our fellow creature”

Conclusion : 
Derrida is here (1:105) focused on a very different sort of beast: he is interested in the fact that the sovereignty implied in all declarations of the rights of man, even when extended to include the rights of women, children, and animals, still relies on an ipse dixit, the “he himself” of voiced authority, the ipsissimus upon which all claims of superlative sovereignty rest. - Beast and Sovereign summary

we understand that the manipulation of domestic minorities is a formative moment in the self-construction of national majorities. Knowing who and what a religious-racial minority is, is an essential stage in knowing who and what a national majority is, and is not: the stable, leg- ible categories of the one fiction enabling and stabilizing the categories of the other. - geraldine heng
