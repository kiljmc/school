###The Political Unveiled

While the previous section focused on the decline of the veil in the West, another important factor is the resurgence of the veil in the East in the late twentieth century because the East also saw periods of rises and falls in veil use (Turkey and Iran even banned the veil for periods of the twentieth century). While scholars such as Ahmed, and El-Guindi examine this question in particular, one of the most illuminating sources on the resurgence of the veil comes from Frantz Fanon in his essay "Algeria Unveiled."

As Fanon recounts, the veil's reawakening occurs as a result of colonial conflict (in this case the Algerian revolution). During the French colonial era, the colonizers viewed the veil in the same terms that contemporary media uses: a leftover form of medieval oppression of women. But Fanon highlights how for the French colonial administration wiping out the veil would also destroy the people's originality and resistance. He writes, "The officials of the French administration in Algeria, committed to destroying the people's originality ... were to concentrate their efforts on the wearing of the veil, which was looked upon at this juncture as a symbol of the status of the Algerian woman" (37). Fanon argues that a "a blanket indictment against the "sadistic and vampirish" AlgeÂ­rian attitude toward women was prepared and drawn up" (38); however, this attitude towards the veil existed well before. He may be right that the modern propaganda and media coverage of the veil began in Algeria but the attitudes themselves develop well before. Nevertheless, the idea that "[b]ehind the visible, manifest patriarchy, the more significant existence of a basic matriarchy was affirmed" informed the decision to target the veil: the way to colonial dominance was through the women. Thus, Fanon likens the rendering of the veil to the act of rape: 

    Unveiling this woman is revealing her beauty; it is baring her secret, breaking her resistance, making her available for adventure. Hiding the face is also disguising a secret; it is also creating a world of mystery, of the hidden...to make her a possible object of possession...Thus the rape of the Algerian woman in the dream of a European is always preceded by a rending of the veil. (43-5)

Yet the decision to unveil the Algerian women had the opposite effect. The veil "helped the Algerian woman to meet the new problems created by the struggle" (63) by allowing them to carry weapons of the resistance. Under the cover over their veils, they carried the guns revolutionaries would use to attack the French police. Eventually when the colonizers clued on to this use of the veil and started screening people at the French quarter's entry points, the Algerian women donned French clothes. Yet this too had the opposite effect. As Fanon writes, "The veil protects, reassures, isolates" (59). When performing terrorist activities like planting bombs, the sense of being watched heightens. An extreme sense of discomfort occurs. Combining this feeling with the already alien feeling of being out of the veil and under the male's gaze at bar, then it is no surprise that the young women of Algeria would find comfort in the veil.[^2] Yet another effect occurred from "his [the colonizer] endeavor to unveil the women, to make of them an ally in the work of cultural destruction, [that] had the effect of strengthening the traditional patterns of behavior" (49); women re-donned the veil after wearing French clothes for terrorist activity. For these women, to wear the veil was to belong to a group that opposed the colonizer: to reaffirm their identity and their resistance to the colonial powers. Fanon recounts,  "Spontaneously and without being told, the Algerian women who had long since dropped the veil once again donned the hai'k, thus affirming that it was not true that woman liberated herself at the invitation of France and of General de Gaulle" (62). The veil became a "positive, self-affirming political force" (Yegenoglu 560). This position as a political force and symbol for identification in the twentieth century enters the veil into a discussion with Carl Schmitt's concept of the political.

In his work _The Concept of the Political_, Schmitt lays out what he sees as the essence of politics: the friend-enemy grouping.
