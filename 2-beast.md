becomes even more evident in Hirschfeld’s report from Bern: "The ladies of Bern have been reproached for sequestering their faces from the profane gaze of men by means of veils, just as the fair sex does in Turkey. As far as I have seen, the veil, made usually of white muslin [Flohr], is worn only in the summer. The advantages that a woman may gain against the sun, air and flying pests would be recommendation enough, were it not that the desire to please adds yet another one. Everyone knows that a pretty face, of which Bern has so many, looks even more charming under muslin; half-concealed beauty emerges so charmingly, like the dawn rays of a day in May through a light mist; and the agreeable impatience to see more is worth more than an unobstructed gaze that offers immediate satisfaction."

For, as Hobbes concedes, fear is at the heart of the Common-wealth portrayed in Leviathan, the fear that motivates citizens to obey the law and to submit to the will of the sovereign. “Sovereignty makes us afraid, and fear makes the sovereign,” writes Derrida in the voice of Hobbes (  Derrida Beast and Sovereign


The positive and even romantic treatments of Muslims are, however, trivial when considered alongside the grand narrative about Islam, an overwhelmingly negative and dehumanizing treatment that has its origins in the Middle Ages, sees its development in pre-modernity, and is cemented into the Western consciousness through colonialism and Orientalism.

Male Muslim monsters are typically hyper-masculine—aggressive, overly sexual, and violent—characters that also function as tableaux of desire and fantasy.

The creation of monsters is a political act, and monsters are politi- cal creatures.
By dehumanizing the Muslim as a dangerous m ster, one can justify the extermination of this threat.

Like all monsters, the female characters included here—cannibalistic Saracens, vampires, and others—vary con- siderably depending on the anxiety in force, although the overwhelming majority of female Muslim monsters are cast as sexually toxic.

The Ottoman Empire was frequently described as the Antichrist, a monster, or a beast, as “that mon- ster of Turkish tyranny [that] hath too long reigned and laid the earth

desolate.”

The identity of Shakespeare’s Othello is a bit more complicated. While he denies his Muslim identity, and speaks strongly against Muslims in the play, his Moorish ancestry is what eventually does Othello in. Othello makes clear his hatred for the Turks, including the final scene before his death, when he calls the Muslim a “circumcised dog.” 74 Yet, his descent into madness is predicated on his racial and religious foundations. He is unable to escape either his blackness or his Muslim bloodlines.

In Elizabethan England, portrayals of Prophet Muhammad often relied on medieval polemics, resulting in characterizations as a heretic and sexual pervert. In some examples from literature and drama, the Prophet took the form of a monster, a dreaded beast, or as a “Mungrell born” creature with a scalded head. 5

Miscegenation is a central theme in Othello, expressed in both the act of mixed-race sex and the horrors it could create. The image of Othello and Desdemona having sex is described as “an old black ram. . . tupping [a] white ewe” and “the beast with two backs.” 84 This union would result in a family of monsters, illustrated in Iago’s warning that, “[y]ou’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have coursers for cousins, and gennets for

Germans.” 85

The cook at first resists, but, threatened with the loss of his own head, returns on his knees with the black, grinning head of the dead (and eaten) Saracen,in a scene that triumphantly stages the horror of the head,its racial difference, and its inhuman, devilish nature. Narrative attention zeroes in on the black face and black beard of the detached head, set off against white teeth that are bared by widely grinning lips (3211–13). Richard’s re- sponse (“What devil is this?” 3214) is extravagant laughter. He had not known before, he exclaims, that Saracen flesh was this delicious: now his army would never lack for food, since they were able, in any assault, to slay Saracens and take their flesh to boil, roast, or bake, gnawing the flesh to the bones; never again would he and his men fear hunger in their campaign of conquest in the Levant (3216–3226) geraldine heng



Accordingly, when Hobbes founds sovereignty by means of a reference to the state in which "man is a wolf to men," homo hominis lupus, in the word "wolf " (lupus) we ought to hear an echo of the wargus and the caput lupinem of the laws of Edward the Confessor: at issue is not simply fera bestia and natural life but rather a zone of indistinction between the human and the animal, a werewolf, a man who is transformed into a wolf and a wolf who is transformed into a man -- in other words, a bandit, a homo sacer. Far from being a prejuridical condition that is indifferent to the law of the city, the Hobbesian state of nature is the exception and the threshold that constitutes and dwells within it. It is not so much a war of all against all as, more precisely, a condition in which everyone is bare life and a homo sacer for everyone else, and in which everyone is thus wargus, gerit caput lupinum. And this lupization of man and humanization of the wolf is at every moment possible in the dissolutio civitatis inaugurated by the state of exception. Agamben

Medieval literature includes other types of female Muslim characters, many of whom figure prominently in conversion narratives. Saracen females who convert to Christianity are usually represented as white, a reversal of the dark-skinned or Black Saracen male monster. 145 White Muslim females do not represent “a realistic portrayal of the medieval French view of the Saracen body but illustrate desire on the part of the white male authors of the text.” 146 These characters are not realistic por- trayals, but rather expressions of desire for the exotic Other, which was often situated in fantasies about racial and sexual difference.

a horrible female monster is created and then destroyed; and there are the murderous women, at times cast as Catholics (a sign of medievalism and decay) and at other times as Orientals, or immoral Christian women, who pay dearly for their slutty ways. Muslim imagination

Orientalist descriptions of Muslim women are an extension of the Orient as a commodity. Muslim women were described as exhibiting a “revolting immorality,” and exhibiting their unrestrained sexuality in pub - lic, much like the depictions of other desirable non-European females. 83 In one description, Muslim dancers perform in “a blaze of Oriental vice,” “heads and breasts now thrown back, now thrown forward to within a hand’s breath of my face, their flesh quivering.” 84 Classification and acqui- sition were key processes in the Orientalist project, and “the desire to sexually possess the other” was a key “part of [the] colonialist heritage. ibid

Muslim female monsters emerged in the colonial era because of the multiplicity of ways that Muslim female bodies were envisioned— “as mother, evil seducer, licentious aberration.” 91 This gave the imagi- nation new space in which to create monsters.
