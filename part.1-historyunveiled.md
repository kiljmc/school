### History Unveiled

In his book _The New Orientalists_, Ian Almond basically makes the case that many of the famous continental thinkers of the twentieth century engage in the same Orientalists practices that Said criticized. Friedrich Nietzsche and Foucault fall under particular scrutiny for exoticizing the Middle East, but he also criticizes Derrida and Zizek among others in his book of doing the same. He charges these theorists with using the Orient as a place from which to criticize Western culture, but the Orient that appears in there texts does not necessarily reflect any sort of reality within the Middle East. Put basically, they are the other half to the Orientalists who derided and infantalized the Orient in Said's book: 
    [I]n attempting to write about the Other, we invariably end up writing about ourselves has become a cliché of Orientalist studies – ‘extending the Empire of the Same’, as Levinas called it; what remains surprising is that so many of the ﬁgures responsible for delineating and demonstrating this situation of epistemological ﬁnitude so visibly fail to escape it in their own work. (203)
 His criticisms are fair and as this paper uses these theorists in its analysis of an Orientalist practice, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the difficulties in analyzing cultures distinct from one's own. In that spirit, I do not intend to make any judgments about Islamic cultures rather I want to interrogate Western conceptions of Muslims. However, his criticism of Western thinkers often takes its cues from the comparison of contemporary Islamic culture to that of the medieval. He quotes Salman Sayyid as saying "that Europe sees Islam as a return of the medieval" (49). In relation to head scarves and veil, the medieval serves as an important starting point.
 In her essay _Time Behind the Veil_, Kathleen Davis already presents a focused criticism on the "the significations so violently imposed upon women in contemporary political and cultural struggles" (Davis 117). She criticizes contemporary media for the "trope of “returning to the Middle Ages” when visiting the Middle East and Said for "reinforc[ing] rather than disrupt[ing] Westernizing temporal logic by insisting that the Middle Ages provided the textual material for Orientalism and yet was fully prior to any actual practice of Orientalism" (107).
