### History Unveiled

In his book _The New Orientalists_, Ian Almond basically makes the case that many of the famous continental thinkers of the twentieth century engage in the same Orientalists practices that Said criticized. Friedrich Nietzsche and Foucault fall under particular scrutiny for exoticizing the Middle East, but he also criticizes Derrida and Zizek among others in his book of doing the same. He charges these theorists with using the Orient as a place from which to criticize Western culture, but the Orient that appears in there texts does not necessarily reflect any sort of reality within the Middle East. Put basically, they are the other half to the Orientalists who derided and infantalized the Orient in Said's book: 
    [I]n attempting to write about the Other, we invariably end up writing about ourselves has become a cliché of Orientalist studies – ‘extending the Empire of the Same’, as Levinas called it; what remains surprising is that so many of the ﬁgures responsible for delineating and demonstrating this situation of epistemological ﬁnitude so visibly fail to escape it in their own work. (203)
 His criticisms are fair and as this paper uses these theorists in its analysis of an Orientalist practice, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the difficulties in analyzing cultures distinct from one's own. In that spirit, I do not intend to make any judgments about Islamic cultures rather I want to interrogate Western conceptions of Muslims. However, his criticism of Western thinkers often takes its cues from the comparison of contemporary Islamic culture to that of the medieval. He quotes Salman Sayyid as saying "that Europe sees Islam as a return of the medieval" (49). In relation to head scarves and veil, the medieval serves as an important starting point.
 
Discussions around the veil and its depiction as "medieval" in western media have already occurred. In her essay _Time Behind the Veil_, Kathleen Davis already presents a focused criticism on the "the significations so violently imposed upon women in contemporary political and cultural struggles" (Davis 117).  In her analysis, Davis first "interrogates the gendered temporalities of Orientalist discourses such as _Behind the Veil_ [an ABC-TV news special]" (107). To do so, she draws on the work of Homi Bhabha and Julia Kristeva to show that medeivalism has become conflated with "these struggles over veiling and unveiling women involv[ing] constellated national and multinational agendas" (109). Secondly, Davis "traces the logic and implications of the medievalism in Said’s _Orientalism_" (107) to show that he over-generalizes in discussions of medieval Orientalism but more importantly that his dichotomy between Orient and Occident reinforces contemporary Orientalism: 
    [I]t [his dichotomy] instates a core “reality” that privileges and solidifies the very discourse he critiques. If we grant with Said that me- dieval Europe’s system of representing Islam is purely antiempirical, based not on any experience with Islam but only on a fully closed, self-generated tradition, then we privilege Europe as an absolutely self-constituting object. (113)
In the third portion of her analysis, Davis reads Geoffrey Chaucer's _Man of Law's Tale_ under Orientalist methodology. In this section, she mainly shows how Said's arguments concerning the genesis of Orientalist study is wrong and that women play an important role in signifying the difference between East and West. In her estimation, Said is wrong because medieval Orientalism did not spring from an isolated experience; rather, medieval Europe engaged in significant trade and warfare with the East and therefore the "real" Orient runs through the formation of the European identity. Her critique of Chaucer shows how authors retroactively made distinctions between Islam and Christianity: European and Turk in early European history based on contemporary struggles (e.g. the Crusades, growing Turkish power, etc.). While I do not generally agree with Davis's critique of Said, her positioning of women in the formation of Orient and Occident foreshadows how the veil will eventually mark the Western and Eastern temporal divide.

While Davis touches on the veil's role in the temporal divide, she ignores its history between the two regions. Fadwa El Guindi survey's examines a portion of the veil's history in her book _Veil: Modesty, Privacy and Resistance_ which generally focuses on its use in Islamic culture; however, she does provide a comparative analysis of its use in other cultures. In her examination, she splits veiling into 5 different functions: "(1) complementary, as in Sumeria; (2) exclusionary and privileging as in the Persian-Mesopotamian case; (3) egalitarian, as in Egypt; (4) hierarchical, as in Hellenic culture; and (5) seclusionary, as in Byzantine culture" ("The Veil in Comparative Tradition"). As she demonstrates, the ancient cultures of the Mediterranean area used the veil frequently and for different measures. For example, early Church father Tertullian who wrote in Carthage around 208 CE mentions that "Arabia's heathen females will be your judges, who cover not only the head, but the face also, so entirely, that they are content, with one eye free, to enjoy rather half the light than to prostitute the entire face" ("An Appeal to the Married Women"). Clearly, the practice of veiling in niqab fashion precedes the birth of Muhammad; however, Tertullian's point on Arab women means to convince Christian women to do the same: "[W]e admonish you, too, women of the second (degree of) modesty, who have fallen into wedlock, not to outgrow so far the discipline of the veil" ("Married Women"). Right up until the late medieval era in Europe women's "[h]air was generally covered with a linen veil, and in the twelfth century the neck and chin were also covered by a cloth called a barbet.The two cloths were later joined to form a single head covering, the wimple" (Steele 21). While fashions varied and never reached the level of the niqab, the veil's presence in Europe lasted some time.

For whatever reason, perhaps the rise of the bourgeoisie and new economic developments, scientific and technological advancement, a shift in social and religious life (i.e. the Reformation), or even a desire to distance themselves from Turkish fashion, the veil in Europe gradually disappeared during the Early Modern period.  

Arab privacy does not connote the “personal,” the “secret” or the “individuated space.” It concerns two core spheres – women and the family. For both, privacy is sacred and carefully guarded. For women it is both a right and an exclusive privilege, and is reflected in dress, space, architecture and proxemic behavior



I argue for the centrality of the cultural notion of privacy, as one that embodies the qualities of reserve, respect and restraint as these are played out in fluid transformational bi-rhythmic space. Dress in general, but particularly veiling, is privacy's visual metaphor

There is a tradition of gender segregation and public seclusion of women in the Judaic and Christian traditions that is rooted in conceptions of the purity and impurity of women and connections between womanhood and nature. These conceptions have a bearing on individual self-image and the public and religious sense of self. On the basis of ethnographic and textual evidence this perspective that derives its meaning from Judaic roots, when uncritically applied to other groups, distorts and misrepresents cultural constructions of womanhood unique to these other groups. For example, these notions do not have an Arabo-Islamic basis. Gender separations in Arabo-Islamic societies must be examined in a different framework. A subtle and nuanced divide, but one that makes a difference, exists between religious cultures
